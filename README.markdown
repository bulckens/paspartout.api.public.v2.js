## What is it?
Official JavaScript wrapper for the Paspartout.com public API.

## Who should use it?

## Usage

### Installation

Include the file in your page:

    <script src="paspartout.api.public.v2.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

### Configuration

Before you perform any Paspartout related action define the site api id of the site you want to approach:

    Paspartout.config.siteId = 'ppt-123456789';

The site api id can be found under 'settings' > 'Paspartout API'.
Note that the length of the key can vary from site to site.


### Load the Site

    Paspartout.Api.Site.load({
      success: function(site) {
        ... your code ...
      },
      failure: function(error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
    });

The object passed as the first argument in the success callback the site object including the following fields:

- title <small>_(meta title)_</small>
- description <small>_(meta description)_</small>
- subdomain <small>_(e.g. subdomain.paspartout.com)_</small>
- host

- footer <small>_(full Paspartout footer info)_</small>


### Load a Page

    Paspartout.Api.Page.load(page_id_or_permaname, {
      success: function(page) {
        ... your code ...
      },
      failure: function(error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
    });

The object passed as the first argument in the success callback the page object including the following (possible) fields:

- type
- id
- name
- permaname <small>_(except for external page or a blog that is used externally)_</small>
- url

The field sets vary for each page type.


### Load Pages

    Paspartout.Api.Page.all({
      success: function(pages) {
        ... your code ...
      },
      failure: function(error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
    });

The first argument in the success callback is an array with all active pages.


### Load Comments

    Paspartout.Api.Comment.all({
      success: function(comments) {
        ... your code ...
      },
      failure: function(error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
    });

The first argument in the success callback is an array with approved comments.

Optionally you can provide the 'pageId' option to scope comments to a given page:

    Paspartout.Api.Comment.all({
      pageId: page_id_or_permaname,
      
      success: function(comments) {
        ... your code ...
      },
      failure: function(error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
    });

By default a basic page object is included for each comment.


### Load Images

    Paspartout.Api.Image.all({
      success: function(comments) {
        ... your code ...
      },
      failure: function(error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
    });

The first argument in the success callback is an array with images.

Like comments you can optionally provide the 'pageId' option to scope images to a given page:

    Paspartout.Api.Image.all({
      pageId: page_id_or_permaname,
      
      success: function(comments) {
        ... your code ...
      },
      failure: function(error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
    });


### Include or exclude

When loading a portfolio page for example its children (the projects) are included by default.
You can prevent that by passing the following option:

    Paspartout.Api.Page.load(page_id_or_permaname, {
      include: {
        children: false
      },
      
      success...
    });

When loading a blog post on the other hand, comments are not included.
To include them:

    Paspartout.Api.Page.load(page_id_or_permaname, {
      include: {
        comments: true
      },
      
      success...
    });

This also works when loading a blog page.
The comments for every post will then be included.


### Other options

Other options are:

- order: <i>(the position order in which the records are loaded; options per record type are listed below)</i>
  - project: name, position, created_at, updated_at or random
  - post: name, created_at, updated_at, published_at or random
  - product: name, position, price, created_at, updated_at or random
  - comment: name, created_at, updated_at or random
  - image: title, position, color, created_at, updated_at or random
- way: <i>(the direction of the order; only asc and desc are possible)</i>
- per_page:  <i>(the amount of records that are loaded; defaults to 30 if no value found in the paspartout settings)</i>
- page: <i>(the page in pagination; for example if you have 40 projects and 30 per_page, project 32 will be on page 2)</i>

Data you load will be cached.
The second time you request the same url you will get the cached data returned.
To get a fresh version of the url pass this option:

- cache: false <i>(false will prevent caching and force the data to be reloaded)</i>

## Important

The Paspartout API is currently in beta.
As the API evolves this library will be updated as well.

This library is framework agnostic.
If any problems arise, please let me know.

## Testing

The included specs test the basic functionality.
Tests are performed against a Paspartout Biz test site (http://gmc.paspartout.com/).
